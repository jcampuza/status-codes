    <h3>About Status Codes</h3>

    <p>
      Mostly Placeholder: Hi there! Status Codes is a simple app with a twofold goal. 
      One was to be a one stop shop to be a location for looking up http status codes
      for both those who are learning, and for professionals to reference.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second goal was to be a source for those who want to make an attempt at
      memorizing the most common http status codes, as well as the more obscure that
      may not be encountered very often.
    </p>
