### Status Codes

Status Codes is a project to help users memorize HTTP status codes, both common and uncommon. It will include a browse view which allows users to search for status codes, as well as some simple randomized shuffling of statuses in order to test your current knowledge.

The goal is to get some experience using `Hyperapp` as well as some of it's official supporting libraries like `@Hyperapp/Router`. 

The project uses `Parcel` for building as well as developing with hot reloading/updating.
